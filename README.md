# unicefRetClubsToContactFinder
Welcome to the UNICEF Clubs NC Retention Project Clubs to contact calculator!

This finder takes 2 sets of data... one for the list of previously approved clubs in the past year (ie clubs we would like to retain) and a separate list of clubs that are already approved for this year. 

The program then calculates and shares a list of clubs you still need to contact to retain.

Each of your inputs for club lists should be line break separated. It also helps to have alphabetically sorted the lists from A-Z in Sheets (Highlight the desired column and Sort the column alphabetically). Please do not put any other text on the file.


What you need — a sheet with a column with the schools you have already approved and don’t need to call. Next to that the list of clubs from last year (the clubs to retain) and next to that the corresponding data for the clubs you need to retain’s contact/other info


HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM: (https://github.com/ishangoyal100/unicefRetClubsToContactFinder)

Click on the green Code Button and Click Download ZIP. — only the first time.
Open the UNICEF-Retention-V1 folder when done downloading. 
Go to the previousSchools txt file and open that. 
Replace all of the text with the names of all the schools from last year (want to retain). 
Save the file and close it. 
Go to the newSchools txt file and open that. 
Replace all of the text with the names of all the schools already accepted this year (have retained). 
Save the file and close it.
Depending on the IDE you are using, the next step may differ. But I'm showing it using BlueJ. 
Right click on Retv1 in the folder and click 'open with' (at least on mac). 
On Mac, you have to change 'Recommended Apps' to 'All Apps.' Find BlueJ or whichever IDE (you can use the search in the Finder) and double click it. 
You should now see a yellow box that says Retv1. Right click it and selet void main and hit OK. (Other IDE users, just run the program) 
Now go back to your downloaded folder and double click on the "SchoolsToContact.txt" and that's your list of just schools!


Now go back to sheets and organize last year’s list alphabetically. 
First, make a sheet with just last year’s schools and their info. group every row by clicking the leftmost topmost gray bar and Holding shift until you get to the leftmost bottom-most gray bar. 
Right click and group rows. 
Now click on any one of the school names and do group sheet A-Z by column.

Now, we will use the second code file (retv2)

In the previousSchool2 file put all of last year’s schools from the alphabetical order you just made and save the file. 
Now do the same but in the newSchools2 file using age data you created in SchoolsToContact.txt and save it too. 
Go to the RetV2 file and run it. Open the SchoolsToContact2. Select all and copy. Go back to sheets and replace the list of all schools with the data in the results file.
Now you should have all of the schools to contact left. Now click a school. And go back to the sort and do it for the sheet by column. 
Go to the last row that has a school. You can delete all of the data below the row.

Hopefully it worked :)
Please do go back over it after you are done. There is usually a shift by a couple of lines and that messes stuff up.


----------
FIRST TIME USERS:
Download an IDE if you don't already have one! It takes 2 minutes and just takes a click even if you're not a coding person and don't know what an IDE is.
https://bluej.org/   --> select Mac or Windows and allow on any permissions it asks for. That should be it.
