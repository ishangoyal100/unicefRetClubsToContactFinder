# unicefRetClubsToContactFinder

Welcome to the UNICEF Clubs NC Retention Prject Clubs to contact calculator!

This finder takes 2 sets of data... one for the list of previously approved clubs in the past year (ie clubs we would like to retain) and a separate list of clubs 
that are already approved for this year. The program then calculates and shares a list of clubs you still need to contact to retain.

Each of these should be line break separated. It also helps to have alphabetically sorted the lists from A-Z in Sheets (Highlight the desired column and Sort the *column* alphabetically). Please do not put any other text on the file.

For example:

Main Street High School
Saint High School
Xavier College

HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM: (https://github.com/ishangoyal100/unicefRetClubsToContactFinder)

Click on the green Code Button and Click Download ZIP. Open the folder when done downloading.
Go to the previous schools txt file and open that. replace all of the text with the names of all the schools from last year (want to retain). Save the file and close it.
Go to the new schools txt file and open that. replace all of the text with the names of all the schools already accepted this year (have retained). Save the file and close it.

Depending on the IDE you are using, the next step may differ. But I'm showing it using BlueJ.
Right click on Retv1 in the folder and click 'open with' (at least on mac). On Mac, you have to change 'Recommended Apps' to 'All Apps.'
Find BlueJ or whichever IDE (you can use the search in the Finder) and double click it.
You should now see a yellow box that says Retv1. Right click it and selet void main and hit OK. (Other IDE users, just run the program)
Now go back to your downloaded folder and double click on the "SchoolsToContact.txt" and that's your list!

----------
FIRST TIME USERS:
Download an IDE if you don't already have one! It takes 2 minutes and just takes a click even if you're not a coding person and don't know what an IDE is.
https://bluej.org/   --> select Mac or Windows and allow on any permissions it asks for. That should be it.
